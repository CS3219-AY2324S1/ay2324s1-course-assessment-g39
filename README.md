# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Quickstart

Start Docker engine and initialize the `.env` file. Then:

```bash
    yarn
    yarn docker:up
    yarn prisma:push # run this whenever you change the schema
    yarn dev
```

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
